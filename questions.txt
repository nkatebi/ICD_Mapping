How many 1 to 1 mappings are there?
ICD 9 to 10 : 22100
ICD 10 to 9 : 71829


How many 1 to many mappings are there? In general, is the concept on the 1 side equivalent to the concepts on the many side?  Yes, the concept is the same in both sides but when we have one to many mapping there is more information in many side.

ICD 9 to 10 : 2338
ICD 10 to 9 : 9033


How many terms have no mappings?
ICD 9 to 10 : 422
ICD 10 to 9 : 731


Given the goal of resolving all 1:many mappings down to 1:1 mappings, which mapping direction (10>9 or 9>10) is more feasible? 
Mapping ICD 9 to 10 is more feasible because there are more details in icd 10 so mapping 1:many to 1:1 would be easier.
